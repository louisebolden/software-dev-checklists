# Before Deploying

The submitter and reviewer should always take a minute to ask each other the following:

1. What are we worried about going wrong?
2. Is there anything different about this change in different environments (dev, test, staging, prod)?
3. Is now an optimal time to deploy this change?
4. Is it possible or desirable to roll this out to a subset of users (e.g. beta testers)?
5. What specific steps will each of us take when the deploy finishes to verify that the changes work?
6. If something goes wrong, what will we do? Is this something that is safe to revert and re-deploy?
