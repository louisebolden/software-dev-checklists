# When Reviewing a Pull Request

The reviewer should always ask themselves the following:

1. Do I understand the goal of this change?
2. Have I looked at every line of the diff between the branch and master?
3. Have I used the code locally?
4. Should this go through additional QA?
5. Are there sufficient unit and functional tests?
6. How will we know if this change "works"?
